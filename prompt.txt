The equations are:

dx/dt = \sigma * (y - x)
dy/dt = x * (\rho -x) - y
dz/dt = x*y -\beta*z

The function should be named ode_func.
It should take three arguments: t, x, and p.
The argument p should be a dict, x should be a list, and t should be a float.
Add one line docstrings and typehints.
Assume Python 3.12.
Make it independent of numpy and typing module.
Wrap the function in a code block.
